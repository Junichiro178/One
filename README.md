・Match.com
・Pairs
The problems of these apps is not kind for Japanese ✖︎ foreigners match. For example all dating apps from Japan doesn't have good English platform because most of Japanese cannot use English at all, that is why foreigners doesn't use that apps. And some apps from other countries is already too famous in Japan so there are more Japanese registrants than foreign registrants. ONE created to solve this problem and provide easier way to find new matches.
